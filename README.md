# NLP Sentiment Analysis App
📱 Product Review analysis

This project is a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline that performs **sentiment analysis** on text data. It includes text preprocessing, feature extraction using **TF-IDF**, model training using **Naive Bayes**, and a user-friendly **Streamlit web app** for live predictions.

## 🚀 Features :

- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Sentiment classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Accuracy evaluation on test data
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit
- Real-time sentiment prediction (Positive, Neutral, Negative)

## 🗃️ Files Included :

- `aftab_P556.py` – Python script containing the ML pipeline
- `app_P556.py` – Streamlit app file for deployment
- `P556.xlsx` – Dataset used for training/testing
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

## Text Preprocessing : 
Lowercasing, Removing Puntuations, Emojis, Stopwords, Numbers, Stemming.
